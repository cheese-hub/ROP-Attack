## What is R2?

dafaf


# li
-The iI command is used in r2 to display important information about a binary file.
-This information includes the file format, architecture, and bitness of the binary.
-The file format refers to whether the binary file is in the ELF or PE format, for example.
-Architecture refers to the type of machine architecture, such as x86 or ARM.
-Bitness refers to whether the binary file is 32-bit or 64-bit.
-Understanding this information can help determine the appropriate analysis techniques and tools to use.
-For example, knowing the architecture can guide whether to use ARM-specific or x86-specific tools.
-Understanding the bitness can inform how to approach memory analysis and debugging.
# pdf
+--------------------------------------------+
| The `pdf` command in radare2 is a powerful |
| tool for displaying the assembly code and  |
| pseudo code of the current function. With  |
| the `pdf` command, users can quickly       |
| understand the operations of the current   |
| function and the execution flow of each    |
| instruction.                                |
|                                            |
| When using the `pdf` command, users can     |
| specify different options to control the   |
| display content and format. Here are some  |
| commonly used options:                      |
|                                            |
| - `pdf`: Displays the assembly code and    |
|   pseudo code of the current function.     |
| - `pdf@<addr>`: Displays the assembly code |
|   and pseudo code of the function at the   |
|   specified address.                       |
| - `pdf~<regex>`: Searches for functions     |
|   whose name or comment contains the       |
|   specified regular expression and         |
|   displays their assembly code and pseudo  |
|   code.                                    |
| - `pdfj`: Displays the JSON format         |
|   representation of the current function,  |
|   including information such as            |
|   instructions, blocks, and operations.    |
| - `pdfd`: Displays the data flow graph of  |
|   the current function, which shows the    |
|   flow path of data in the function.       |
| - `pdfm`: Displays the call graph of the   |
|   current function, which shows the call   |
|   relationship between the current         |
|   function and other functions.            |
|                                            |
| By using different options with the `pdf`  |
| command, users can obtain different levels |
| of analysis results, helping with reverse  |
| engineering and binary analysis. For       |
| example, using the `pdfd` option can help   |
| identify the data flow path in the         |
| function and determine the source and      |
| destination of the data flow, which can    |
| help understand the behavior and purpose   |
| of the function.                            |
|                                            |
| Overall, the `pdf` command is a powerful    |
| and flexible tool in radare2 that can help  |
| users with function-level analysis and     |
| reverse engineering.                        |

# afl & izz
+---------------------------------------------+
| The `afl` command in radare2 is used for     |
| fuzzing binaries with American Fuzzy Lop    |
| (AFL) instrumentation. AFL is a popular     |
| binary fuzzing tool that leverages          |
| instrumentation and genetic algorithms to   |
| find vulnerabilities in programs. With the  |
| `afl` command, users can easily prepare     |
| and run AFL fuzzing sessions on their        |
| target binary, and visualize the coverage   |
| data collected during the fuzzing process.  |
|                                             |
| The `afl` command has various options that  |
| can be used to fine-tune the fuzzing         |
| process. Here are some commonly used        |
| options:                                     |
|                                             |
| - `afl`: Starts the AFL fuzzing process on   |
|   the current binary.                       |
| - `afl-config`: Configures the AFL           |
|   environment variables and settings.       |
| - `afl-showmap`: Displays the code coverage  |
|   information collected during the AFL      |
|   fuzzing process.                           |
| - `afl-cmin`: Minimizes the test cases       |
|   collected during the AFL fuzzing process. |
|                                             |
| Another powerful command in radare2 is the  |
| `izz` command, which is used for analyzing  |
| the import and export tables of the target  |
| binary. With the `izz` command, users can    |
| quickly identify the external functions     |
| that the binary relies on and their details |
| such as address, size, and function name.   |
| The `izz` command can be useful in reverse   |
| engineering and malware analysis, as it     |
| helps understand the binary's dependencies  |
| and behavior.                               |
|                                             |
| Some commonly used options with the `izz`   |
| command include:                             |
|                                             |
| - `izz`: Displays both the import and        |
|   export tables of the binary.              |
| - `izz-`: Displays only the import table.    |
| - `izz+`: Displays only the export table.    |
| - `izz~<regex>`: Searches for symbols whose  |
|   name or comment contains the specified    |
|   regular expression and displays their     |
|   details.                                  |
|                                             |
| Overall, the `afl` and `izz` commands are    |
| two powerful tools in radare2 that can help  |
| users with binary fuzzing and function       |
| analysis.                                    |
